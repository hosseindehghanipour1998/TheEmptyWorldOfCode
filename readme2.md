🕳️ The Empty World Of Code

"In the beginning, there was nothing. Then I pushed to main."
Welcome to The Void, a cutting-edge, bleeding-edge, paradigm-shifting software experience... that does absolutely nothing.

No features.
No bugs.
No dependencies.
No mercy.

🌌 Philosophy

This project explores the profound beauty of emptiness.
While others build, we abstain. While others ship, we contemplate.
Some call it laziness. We call it... minimalism.

“Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add,
but when there is nothing left to take away.”
— Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (probably talking about this repo)
📦 Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/the-void.git
cd TheEmptyWorldOfCode
Congratulations. You now have it all — which is to say, nothing.

🧠 Usage
